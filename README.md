## Events

### 1791

- The starting point of divergence stems from the "Flight to Varennes",
  which originally had the royal family captured at Varennes as a result of having been sighted at their previous stop in Sainte-Menehould.
  Their goal was flee to Montmédy in order to cause a counter-revolution.
  The establishing divergence is that the family is not sighted then captured, and successfully arrive in Montmédy where they organize a counter-revolution. **(OTL: 20–21 June 1791, TTL: Never)**

- The Padua Circular doesn't happen since the King successfully escaped Paris. **(OTL: 6 July 1791, TTL: Never)**

- There is a lack of French émigrés, due to areas of the country becoming areas for counter-revolutionary royalists to rally to. **(OTL: 3 September 1791, TTL: Same)**

- The Assembly in Paris drafts a new Constitution which they adopted. King Louis XVI declines to accept it, calling for a return to order in the country.

- The Declaration of Pillnitz happens, but it's contents are different.
  Due to the royal family not being imprisoned, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, the Queen's brother, is less reluctant about intervention. **(OTL: 27 August 1791, TTL: 27 September 1791)**

- The Assembly still votes to create an army, but instead of being needed only to defend the borders of France, it's also needed in order to handle Louis XVI, with his support from Austria and Prussia. **(OTL: 28 December 1791, TTL: 5 October 1791)**

### 1792

-- TODO: Assembly declares the First French Republic, claims king is no longer legitimate. Now there's a civil war and Louis XVI has the support of Austria and Prussia.
