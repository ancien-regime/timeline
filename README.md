## Events

### France

#### 1791

- The starting point of divergence stems from the "Flight to Varennes",
  which originally had the royal family captured at Varennes as a result of having been sighted at their previous stop in Sainte-Menehould.
  Their goal was flee to Montmédy in order to cause a counter-revolution.
  The establishing divergence is that the family is not sighted then captured, and successfully arrive in Montmédy where they organize a counter-revolution. **(OTL: 21 June 1791, TTL: Never)**

- The Padua Circular doesn't happen since the King successfully escaped Paris. **(OTL: 6 July 1791, TTL: Never)**

- There is a lack of French émigrés, due to areas of the country becoming areas for counter-revolutionary royalists to rally to. **(OTL: 3 September 1791, TTL: Same)**

- The Assembly in Paris drafts a new Constitution which they adopted. King Louis XVI declines to accept it, calling for a return to order in the country.

- The Declaration of Pillnitz happens, but it's contents are different.
  Due to the royal family not being imprisoned, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, the Queen's brother, is less reluctant about intervention. **(OTL: 27 August 1791, TTL: 27 September 1791)**

- The Assembly still votes to create an army, but instead of being needed only to defend the borders of France, it's also needed in order to handle Louis XVI, with his support from Austria and Prussia. **(OTL: 28 December 1791, TTL: 5 October 1791)**

#### 1792

- The Assembly declares the French Republic, citing the King's lack of presence in Paris indicating him and his line as invalid. **(OTL: 22 September 1792, TTL: 1 January 1792)**

- Fighting between royalist and republican forces becomes more common.
  France is effectively in a state of Civil War.
  Fighting is limited to northwestern France with Paris hidden behind nearly 150 kilometers of revolutionary fighters.

- A border incident between the French Republic and Austrians near Mons provides the Holy Roman Emperor enough justification to begin the Empire's intervention into the French Revolutionary War.

#### 1793

- The year 1793 is largely unchanged. The only differences are:

  - The French Republic doesn't declare war on England, The Dutch Republic, or Spain or acquires any new lands.
  - Lyon does not rebel against the convention, since it is held by Royalist France.
  - Marie-Antoinette is not executed since the family is not in Paris.

- the French Republic is losing small amounts of ground, however the events of The Terror do little to help the republic.

#### 1794

- Maximilian Robespierre speaks his speech at the Convention, that would later have him arrested.
  However, when he is freed, rather than attempt a doomed counter-attack, he flees to Le Havre and later boards a ship, ultimately leading him to the United States.
  **(OTL: 26 July 1794, TTL: 15 March 1794)**

- The primary trend of 1794 is the gradual loss of land controlled by the French Republic.
  By this point, those involved in the war who notice their grim fate once the Republic falls begin to prepare their departure from France.
  Many chose to flee across the sea to the United States or British Canada (largely settling in Quebec and Louisiana).

#### 1795

- Paris is retaken by the combined forces of Austria and France, with Prussia on the sidelines.
  Louis XVI returns to Paris after three years of civil war.
  The French Civil War is concluded.
  **(OTL: 3 May 1814, TTL: 23 September 1795)**

#### 1796 - 1836

- The Haitian Revolution doesn't succeed in this timeline without the support of French Royalists or Spain.
  With the closure of the French Civil War at the end of 1795, the revolt is largely suppressed.
  By 1836, the situation is stable.

- No changes to France's borders in Europe.
