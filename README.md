## Events

### France

#### 1791

- The starting point of divergence stems from the "Flight to Varennes",
  which originally had the royal family captured at Varennes as a result of having been sighted at their previous stop in Sainte-Menehould.
  Their goal was flee to Montmédy in order to cause a counter-revolution.
  The establishing divergence is that the family is not sighted then captured, and successfully arrive in Montmédy where they organize a counter-revolution. **(OTL: 21 June 1791, TTL: Never)**
- The Padua Circular doesn't happen since the King successfully escaped Paris. **(OTL: 6 July 1791, TTL: Never)**
- There is a lack of French émigrés, due to areas of the country becoming areas for counter-revolutionary royalists to rally to. **(OTL: 3 September 1791, TTL: Same)**
- The Assembly in Paris drafts a new Constitution which they adopted. King Louis XVI declines to accept it, calling for a return to order in the country.
- The Declaration of Pillnitz happens, but it's contents are different.
  Due to the royal family not being imprisoned, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, the Queen's brother, is less reluctant about intervention. **(OTL: 27 August 1791, TTL: 27 September 1791)**
- The Assembly still votes to create an army, but instead of being needed only to defend the borders of France, it's also needed in order to handle Louis XVI, with his support from Austria and Prussia. **(OTL: 28 December 1791, TTL: 5 October 1791)**

#### 1792

- The Assembly declares the French Republic, citing the King's lack of presence in Paris indicating him and his line as invalid. **(OTL: 22 September 1792, TTL: 1 January 1792)**
- Fighting between royalist and republican forces becomes more common.
  France is effectively in a state of Civil War.
  Fighting is limited to northwestern France with Paris hidden behind nearly 150 kilometers of revolutionary fighters.
- A border incident between the French Republic and Austrians near Mons provides the Holy Roman Emperor enough justification to begin the Empire's intervention into the French Revolutionary War.

#### 1793

- The year 1793 is largely unchanged. The only differences are:
  - The French Republic doesn't declare war on England, The Dutch Republic, or Spain or acquires any new lands.
  - Lyon does not rebel against the convention, since it is held by Royalist France.
  - Marie-Antoinette is not executed since the family is not in Paris.
- the French Republic is losing small amounts of ground, however the events of The Terror do little to help the republic.

#### 1794

- Maximilian Robespierre speaks his speech at the Convention, that would later have him arrested.
  However, when he is freed, rather than attempt a doomed counter-attack, he flees to Le Havre and later boards a ship, ultimately leading him to the United States.
  **(OTL: 26 July 1794, TTL: 15 March 1794)**
- The primary trend of 1794 is the gradual loss of land controlled by the French Republic.
  By this point, those involved in the war who notice their grim fate once the Republic falls begin to prepare their departure from France.
  Many chose to flee across the sea to the United States, Quebec, and Louisiana.

#### 1795

- Paris is retaken by the combined forces of Austria and France, with Prussia on the sidelines.
  Louis XVI returns to Paris after three years of civil war.
  The French Civil War is concluded.
  **(OTL: 3 May 1814, TTL: 23 September 1795)**

#### 1796 - 1836

- The Haitian Revolution doesn't succeed in this timeline without the support of French Royalists or Spain.
  With the closure of the French Civil War at the end of 1795, the revolt is largely suppressed.
  By 1836, the situation is stable.
- There is increased emigration from France to Quebec or Louisiana, with some travelling to the United States as a midway point.
- No changes to France's borders in Europe.

### United States, Louisiana, Canada

- The influx of French revolutionaries fleeing from France to Quebec and Louisiana changed the areas from areas of relatively low conflict to hotbeds of revolutionary fervor.

#### 1798

- Maximilien Robespierre arrives in Quebec after spending a year in the United States.
  The war has ended two years earlier and left him a changed man.
  He meets Pierre-Stanislas Bédard, who is dissatisfied with the British presence in Lower Canada.

#### 1799

- The formation of the Parti canadien happens 7 years earlier due to the influx of French liberals and revolutionaries to Quebec.
  It is still under the leadership of Bédard, who has been meeting with Maximilien Robespierre. **(OTL: 1806, TTL: 1799)**

#### 1800

- The Parti canadien found a newspaper to advertise the message of Parti canadien.
  The newspaper is largely successful in Lower Canada, becoming a household newspaper.
  **(OTL: 22 November 1806, TTL: 23 June 1800)**

#### 1804

- An inflammatory article is published that leads to the arrest of Bédard and the shutting down of the newspaper. While Bédard is eventually released a month later, the situation has soured Quebec to its future with Great Britain.
- Meetings with the Parti canadien, former French revolutionaries, and members of the American government begin to occur in order to organize a revolution.

#### 1805

- Tensions increase in Lower Canada and British soldiers are heckled in the streets.
  The situation eventually escalates to the point militias are formed and a Quebecois Declaration of Independence is being written.

#### 1806

- The situation in Lower Canada finally escalates to the point that the Quebecois Declaration of Independence is tendered to Great Britain.
  Rebels eject the British from Quebec City and Sherbrooke.
  Fighting occurs in the rest of Quebec, centering around Montreal and Trois-Rivières.
- News eventually travels to Washington D.C., where the already negative relations with the British lead to a declaration of war citing grievances against Great Britain and the necessity to protect the fledgling republic.
  There is notable support by the French speaking population in New England, however support in the South is low.
  A large motivation to entering the war for the Americans is the same as the original War of 1812, however there are more concrete discussions with Quebec on the annexation of Canada.
- News also travels to Spanish Louisiana where a notable quantity of French settled, although lesser than Quebec's, where a haphazard movement is formed.
  The movement is largely unnoticed by Spain.

#### 1807

- Various British landings occur, notably at Portsmouth and Portland occur but are repulsed by the end of the year.
- While the American navy cannot defeat the British Royal Navy, the British are incapable of completely blockading the United States and ruining its economy.
- The Quebecois Republic with the aid of the United States takes control of Montreal and Trois-Rivières, securing the region later in 1808.

#### 1808

- British Upper Canada is completely controlled by the Americans and attempts are made to pacify the region until the end of the war.
- A rebellion in New Orleans leads to the colony declaring independence from Spain.
  Support from the United States is sent as a result of lobbying from the Southern states asking for Spanish Florida in the event of pushback from Spain.
- American and Quebecois forces are sent into New Brunswick in order to completely eject the British from Canada, with Nova Scotia the final target.

#### 1809

- The Spanish send a small army from New Spain, however the response is delayed for months, giving the Louisianians time to prepare a defense, defeating the army over a period of days.
  There is no Spanish response for months afterwards.
- Pushes are made by the United States in invading Nova Scotia, though there are difficulties in breaching through British defenses at Truro.
- Forces are being prepared in Quebec for the conquest of Newfoundland, with the operation planned for the middle of 1810.
- The defenses of Truro are slowly decreasing as a result of the large distance between Great Britain and the peninsula.

#### 1810

- There is a victory at Truro with the city taken at the start of the year, and headways are made into the rest of the peninsula.
  There is resistance to the Americans, though it isn't at the scale or defensibility of Truro.
  The peninsula is open for the taking.
- The Quebecois invasion of Newfoundland commences a week after the victory at Truro.
  By the end of the war, there are Quebecois beachheads across the Western coast, though centered at the South of the island.
  There is a gradual movement towards St. John's as well.
- The king in Spain offers to host a peace treaty in Madrid to conclude the Quebecois War of Independence and rebellion in Louisiana.
  Great Britain agrees as support towards the war is at a low and the war is already lost for them.

#### 1811

- The Treaty of Madrid is signed, ending all hostilities in the Americas.
  - Quebec gains its independence from Great Britain.
    Quebec acquires the territories defining Lower Canada, Newfoundland, and the land directly above Lower Canada from Rupert's Land from Great Britain.
  - The United States gains Upper Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the rest of Rupert's Land from Great Britain.
  - The United States purchases West Florida and East Florida from Spain for $2,000,000 and paying residents' claims against the Spanish government up to a total of $5,000,000.
  - The Republic of Louisiana gains its independence from Spain.
    Louisiana grants Spain navigation rights on the Mississippi River for 20 years.

- The war in the Americas are over, with the establishment of two friendly Republics near the United States.
  The constitutions of Quebec and The Republic of Louisiana are similar to the constitution of the former French Republic, while taking greater inspiration from the American constitution.
  The position of the British in North America is greatly diminished to the Caribbean.

#### 1812 - 1836

- There are no major changes due to the continent ending a large regional conflict.
  Emigration occurs as normal for the United States, however there is increased emigration to The Republic of Louisiana.
  Emigration to Quebec has a notable uptick, but is not on the scale of Louisiana

-- TODO: Involve some form of Louisiana purchase where the USA buys Upper Louisiana?
Also do something about New England French speakers?

### Spain

- Without the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and Peninsular war, the history of Spain is radically different in terms of how it controlled its American colonies.

#### 1808

- With the Bourbon monarchy still in control of Spain, there was no need to create the "Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom" as the Spanish monarch still reigned in Madrid. **(OTL: 25 September 1808, TTL: Never)**

#### 1809

- Without the Supreme Central Junta there is no cause for unrest or the establishment of juntas in Quito or Chuquisaca. **(OTL: 25 May 1809, TTL: Never)**

#### 1810 - 1836

- With the situation stable in Spain and lack of liberalizing reforms, Spain still retains control of its possessions in the Americas.
- With the Napoleonic Wars not happening, Spain retains control of Trinidad.
- The war with Louisiana is largely unimportant to Spanish society due to the colony's large French population.
  Rather than committing to a fight that could have been won, it was preferred to lose territory that had no major Spanish presence (except in New Orleans, which was dwarfed by the French population) than risk a pyrrhic victory that would threaten Spain's core colonies in the Americas.

### Netherlands

### 1795

- The invasion of the Cape Colony by Great Britain doesn't occur since the French Revolution doesn't happen.
  Subsequently, the Batavian Republic isn't created and results in no invasion happening. **(OTL: 10 June-15 September 1795, TTL: Never)**

### 1796 - 1836

- As a result of Dutch ownership of the Cape Colony, there is no term "Boer" describing those who left the Cape Colony to escape British rule, since there is no British presence in the Cape.

-- TODO: If it is reasonable to expect there to be a Fifth Anglo-Dutch war, the Netherlands has a good chance of losing Ceylon.
Ceylon is a certain target of Britain's conquest of India.

### Russia

### Great Britain

### Austria

-- TODO
